# disassembler

An disassembler for REGULAR binaries. To use it, clone this repository with its submodules (`git clone https://github.com/regular-vm/disassembler --recursive`) and build it with `g++ -std=c++17 disassembler.cpp -o disassembler`. You can run it by passing a REGULAR binary blob file as a command line argument.
